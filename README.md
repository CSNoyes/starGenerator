# Star Generator

Star Generator automatically stars a GitHub repo with accounts made over a TOR-tunnelled connection. If you know that certain recruiters or HR reps look only at how many stars your repos have, this can be a great way to get around that without begging friends.

To use, edit the following lines in starGenerator.py :
```
GITHUB_REPO = ''
GITHUB_USER= ''
torDirectory = ''
```
Depending on your system version, you will have a different value for torDirectory. The 'Repo' and 'User' fields are self-explanatory.
